- open stepper, make sure it works for (+ 3 4).

- make sure that stepper button appears and disappears as necessary when
language level changes.

- make sure that the stepper works for the #lang htdp/bsl style of language
specification.

- Make sure that you get a warning when you change the underlying program, and a
warning when the program window disappears.

- Try stepping backward and forward through programs with correct and erroneous
(syntax errors, runtime errors) executions, incl. jumping to end.

Here's one to try:

(define (f x)
  (if (empty? x)
      (cons 13 '())
      (cons 4 (f (rest x)))))

(f (list 7 7 7 7))

  - For a syntax error, delete a close paren.

  - For a runtime error, change (cons 13 '()) into 13

- Try programs which print snips (print-convert-test.ss)

- Try programs that contain test cases; make sure that the popups behave sensibly.

e.g.


(check-expect (f (list 4))
              (list 4 13))
(check-expect (f (list 4))
              (list 7 13))

- try big-bang program.

- try SdP program, make sure that test cases don't show extra steps.
